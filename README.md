# Object Detection Using YOLOv8 for Automated Billing System

This project aims to develop an automated billing system using AI techniques such as object detection and image recognition. By leveraging YOLOv8 for object detection and integrating a graphical user interface (GUI), the system accurately identifies products from images, calculates total bills based on their prices, and enhances the checkout experience in retail environments. The images had objects related to stationary. we collected total 1500 images and after augmentation the total number of images were 2900, which was splitted into training, validation and testing by using roboflow.
